Project Iteration 2 - State Machines

- Purpose

The purpose of this iteration is to add the state machines for the scheduler and elevator subsystems assuming that
there is only one elevator. The elevator subsystem is used to notify the scheduler that an elevator has
reached a floor, so that once an elevator has been told to move, the elevator subsystem also has to be informed
so that it can send out messages back to the scheduler to denote the arrival by an elevator.

- File Names

ElevatorSystem.java
	-> The main class which initializes the floorSubsystem(client), elevatorSubsystem(client) and the 
     Scheduler(server) threads and then starts them.
     
Elevator.java
	-> The Elevator thread will try to get requests from the scheduler while it is stationary. 
    -> It will then handle those requests and pass an acknowledgment to the Scheduler to be passed back to the floorSubsystem.
    -> It also changes the states of the state machine.

ElevatorState.java
	-> This interface holds all the methods that the Elevator States use to implement the logic.
	
IdleES.java
	-> This class implements the ElevatorState interface to set the State to Idle and change characteristics of the Elevator.

MovingES.java
	-> This class implements the ElevatorState interface to set the State to Moving and change characteristics of the Elevator.

ArrivedES.java
	-> This class implements the ElevatorState interface to set the State to Arrived and change characteristics of the Elevator.

ElevatorTest.java
	-> A jUNIT test class to test the methods of the Elevator class.

Floor.java
  -> The Floor thread will read in events from an input file and will try to put a request in the scheduler 
     while the previous request has been acknowledged.
	
FloorTest.java
	-> A jUNIT test class to test the methods of the Floor class. Currently empty
	
Information.java
	-> A class that stores the constants of Iteration1 and the enumerators for the lamp state, motor direction, 
     door state and direction lamp.

Scheduler.java
	-> The scheduler thread is a shared resource between the floor and elevator subsystems. The floorSubsystem 
     will place requests into the Scheduler and the elevatorSubsystem will get and handle those requests.

SchedulerTest.java
	-> A jUNIT test class to test the methods of the Scheduler class.

SchedulerStateMachine.java
	-> The scheduler statemachine implements runnable and is in charge of implementing the state machine for the
	scheduler
	
SchedulerStateMachine.java
	-> This test class tests the state transistions of the state machine with how it interprets test data.
	
floorRequests.txt
  -> A text file containing 100 event requests in the form of 
          "TIME FLOOR FLOORBUTTON CARBUTTON"

- Set-up Instructions

	1. Unzip project folder and import into Eclipse
	2. Run ElevatorSystem.java file (main program)
	3. Run SchedulerStateMachineTest.java JUnit file to run unit test
